# RM-scratch
1. [clean.sh](./clean.sh) - remove your wallet, and keys generated
2. [start_nodeos.sh](./start_nodeos.sh) - kills nodeos & removes blockchain directory
3. [setup_system.sh](./setup_system.sh) - creates wallet, and setups chain with new system contracts
4. [setup_contracts.sh](./setup_contracts.sh) - stuff specific to this work (hopefully)

these use [unlock_wallet.sh](./_unlock_wallet.sh) via bash functions to do stuff that might be useful to other projects
